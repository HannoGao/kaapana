## How to Contribute

First of all, we are happy about every piece of code/documentation that you contribute. Communication is key. Please coordinate your contributions ahead of time with us to minimize overhead work for both sides.

We also kindly ask to follow a few rules & guidelines:

* [Sign off your contribution]() (this is a Git feature)
* Follow [the seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* Split your work in easy to digest and coherent commits
* Keep reformatting of existing code to a minimum or do it in a separate commit

That said, please use [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/kaapana/kaapana/compare) for your contribution.
